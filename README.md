# Cornell Astronomy Python Bootcamp
##### By: Aiden Zelakiewicz (asz39@cornell.edu)


Welcome to the Python Bootcamp for Cornell University's Department of Astronomy. This bootcamp is primarily designed for the 2024 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, but is openly available to the wider Cornell Astronomy community. This bootcamp is heavily inspired by the [2022 Cornell REU](https://github.com/CUAstro-REU-Python-Workshop/2022-workshop) bootcamp and Ohio State Astronomy's [Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/giganano/PythonBootcamp) by James Johnson.

What you are seeing currently are files in a GitHub repository, a great tool for version control and storage of code. To download this entire repository, you can either click the <mark style="background-color: #32CD32"><>Code</mark> dropdown menu and download the zip file or type this into the terminal to copy the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Shockblack/Python_Bootcamp.git
```

The bootcamp focuses on using Jupyter Notebooks, which are an interactive way to run Python. Ideally, before the bootcamp, you will have Python installed on your local computer along with Jupyter.
