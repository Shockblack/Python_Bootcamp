Using the Landolt dataset from the first exercise, create a CMD class for the data.
You can find the file in the `Session01` folder.
This class should have the methods and attributes that are similar to what we did in the exercise, such as:
- `read_data` : read in the data file and save its contents
- `plot_cmd`: plot the CMD of the data
- `abs_mv`: calculate the absolute magnitude of the stars
- `distance_modulus`: calculate the distance modulus of the stars
- `distance_pc`: calculate the distance to the stars in parsecs

While you are doing this, try and imagine what other methods could be useful to add to the class and what the uses of a class like this could be.
