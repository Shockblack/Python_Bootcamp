    "As you might already know, Python is what is called an object-oriented language. Things like Numpy `ndarrays` and \"vanilla\" `dictionaries` are both objects, with methods and properties. `Classes` are a powerful component to Python, bundling data and functionality together. One of the most intuitive ways to think about classes is to imagine them as a blueprint for creating objects.\n",

    "## Basics of Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are created using the logic `class class_name:`, with everything indented below being included. Almost every time you create a class, you will start with an `__init__` function. This tells the class what to do upon its creation. When creating a function within a class, you need to pass the function `self` to let the class know this function is part of the object it is creating. Variables within the class can be assigned `self.var` to allow the variable to be callable outside of the class. Otherwise, we cannot call the variable from the object.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, you have used `methods` and `attributes` of objects without even realizing it. When we used `astropy` to get the coordinate transformations, we called `coords.galactic`. This is what is called an `attribute`, and it describes something about the object. We also used `.to()` when we were trying to change the units, which is a `method` of the units object. `Methods` have parentheses because usually you are passing something to the method, while `attributes` are more akin to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An intuitive way of thinking of `methods` and `attributes` is to think of them as verbs and nouns, respectfully. If I am shopping for a car, I might want to know its horsepower. I would likely access that from a `car.horsepower` attribute. While I am test driving that car, I might want to floor it and speed up. In Python, I would likely do that through `car.increase_speed(speed=10)` to increase the speed by 10 miles per hour. "
