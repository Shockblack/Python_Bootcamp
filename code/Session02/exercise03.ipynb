    "In this exercise, we will go over many useful Python packages for astronomy and some of their features. Three of the big package we will overview are `numpy`, `astropy`, and `scipy`. For `numpy` in particular, I will overview some useful features of the package we did not go over in the prior exercises. We will also splash in some `matplotlib` to visualize many of the concepts we will go over. All of these packages work well together, so you should notice some overlap as we proceed."

    "### Units and Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of `astropy` is its ability to handle units (the module is named `units`). If you assign a variable a unit, you can ask `astropy` to convert it do a different standard or do calculations without having to convert things yourself. Don't tell my professors, but I haven't calculated unit conversions by hand in ages thanks to `astropy`. This module alone made using Python my go-to calculator, especially since they work with `numpy` functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another module, which goes hand-in-hand with `astropy.units` is `astropy.constants`. Astropy has a lot of standard constants set, such as Boltzman's constant or Plank's constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a slight learning curve with using `astropy.units`, as you need to know how they define all of the units. Most, however, are very intuitive and you can always check the docs if you're confused!"
